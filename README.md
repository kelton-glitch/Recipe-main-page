## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After some struggle with picking the elements on a side, I finally got it. It felt refreshing

```css
td:last-child {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus more in the future on using components efficiently. The next project will most likely focus on that
